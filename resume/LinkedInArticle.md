# The AI Resume Builder That Got My Wife Hired (and I'm Sharing It Free)

Staring at a blank page, wondering where to even begin with your resume? Feeling overwhelmed by what to include and how to present your experience effectively? You're not alone. Many people struggle with getting started on their resumes, which is exactly why I created this prompt.

My wife was recently navigating the job market, searching for a new opportunity, and like many others, she found the resume writing process incredibly daunting and fraught with anxiety. She asked for my help in editing the resumer, however, I had a different idea (to save me the effort). Why not use AI to make this process easier? So, I set out to create an AI prompt that would act as a personal resume writing assistant.

The result? It was a game-changer. The prompt guided her through the process step-by-step, helping her identify her key skills, quantify her achievements, and craft compelling content. It worked like a charm, and, within short order, I'm thrilled to say she landed her perfect role as the new Director of Sales!

Since then, I've shared the prompt with several friends who were also on the job hunt. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. They've told me how impressed they were with how well it worked, how much easier it made the entire process, and how it helped them create resumes they were truly proud of.

Seeing the positive impact this prompt has had on my wife and friends inspired me to share it with a wider audience. If you're struggling with your resume, feeling lost about where to begin, or simply want to streamline the process, this free AI prompt is here to help. Whether you're building a resume from scratch or have an existing CV you want to enhance, this prompt can transform your job search.

Here's how it works:

* Effortless Content Generation: The AI guides you with insightful questions, helping you articulate your skills and experience, even if you're starting with a blank page or refining an existing resume. This helps you figure out WHAT is important to include.
* Personalized for Every Job: Upload a job description, and the AI will tailor your resume to perfectly match, highlighting the most relevant skills and keywords.

If you're using ChatGPT, you can find my GPT app in the store under my name [Resume Writer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-5Ua2uCT5t-resume-writer). For other platforms, you can download the [prompt from my GitHub repo](https://github.com/opinionated-architect/my-ai-prompts/blob/main/resume/prompt.md) and simply copy/paste it into a prompt window to get started.

**Please Note:** I've noticed that sometimes the AI can get a little over-enthusiastic and ask too many questions at once. If this happens, just remind the AI that you prefer one question at a time. It's in the prompt instructions, but some AIs can be a bit forgetful.
